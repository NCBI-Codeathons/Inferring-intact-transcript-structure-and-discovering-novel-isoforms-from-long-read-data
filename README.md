# Inferring-intact-transcript-structure-and-discovering-novel-isoforms-from-long-read-data

The technological advance of long-read transcript sequencing has changed how we can analyze transcriptomic data. However, with the increased load of long-read transcript data there is an increased need to accurrately and reproducibaly annotate the data. Piplines such as Talon are able to annotate transcriptomic data as isoforms and sqanti is able to classify transcripts based on functionality. This new pipeline will combine the power of Talon and sqanti to detect intact transcripts of high quality as novel isoforms from long read data. With this pipeline, any genome reference can be used to curate transcriptome data and extract usable data on novel isoforms to potentially curate and increase transcriptome knowledge.
