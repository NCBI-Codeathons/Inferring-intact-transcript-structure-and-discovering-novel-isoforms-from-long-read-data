# Inferring-intact-transcript-structure-and-discovering-novel-isoforms-from-long-read-data

Problem
Sequencing technologies have allowed more information on transcriptomes from long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. With increased technologies there is now a lot of long-read data sets that need to be analyzed to learn more about novel isoforms not before able to be curated. With this new pipeline we want to be able to process large data sets of long-read data with high quality and be able to isolate novel transcripts in a usable number to continue curation

Approach: Add preprocess to adapt to curate refseq

Expected results: a collapsed data set of novel isoforms of long read transcripts

How to analyze resuts: 

Future work:
Adapt to other genome references
